  <h4><font face="Georgia">Implications</font></h4>
  <p> Healthcare spending consists of 1/6 of the US Economy, yet there are massive treatment gaps that still exist. Treatment gaps present business opportunities and cases for decreasing costs to insurers and government-subsidized programs, as well as revenue streams for service providers.</p>


<h4><font face="Georgia">Recommendations</font></h4>

    <p>Nationally, the Medicaid population suffers an OUD rate almost 2x the commercial insurance population. Not only do these rates cause alarm by highlighting the disparity in service delivery, they also point to a larger issue: Medicaid enrollees are 2x as likely to have OUD. Below, we will explore this issue further.</p>

  <h4><font face="Georgia">Economic Rationale: the Business Case is also the Government Case</font></h4>
  <p> Economically, the Medicaid population has been the most displaced by automation and offshore labor. As the country has recovered from recession and the US economy has seen 88 straight months of job growth, this indicates that employers are searching for a labor force.</p>
  <p> However, those who suffer from OUD cannot pass a drug screen if they are abusing opioids. The US government spends $70B per year on OUD-related costs in healthcare, law enforcement, judiciary system, and education.</p>
