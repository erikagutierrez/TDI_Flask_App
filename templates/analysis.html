  <h3><font face="Georgia">A Quick Primer on Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and its Treatment</font></h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <br/>
        <li>OUD results from the misuse of opioids: oxycontin, vicodin, percocet, heroin, dilaudid, etc.</li>
        <li>OUD is treated with "softer" forms of opioids: methadone, buprenorhpine, and naltrexone. There are >10 FDA-approved medications for OUD.</li>
        <li>OUD is considered a lifelong illness by the American Society of Addiction Medicine.
          Patients are advised to continue with medication-assisted treatment for life.</li>
        <li>Insurers have not covered addiction-related illness and its associated pharmacy cost until the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and extension in the Affordable Care Act. </li>
        <li>Insurers reimburse healthcare providers based on federal and state guidelines, as well as insurer-provider individual agreements.</li>
        <li>Insurance claims frequently result in provider-insurance company arbitration. Reimbursement can take 3-12 months.</li>
        <li>Drug abuse is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html">leading cause of accidental death</a> in the US.</li>
        <li>Prevalence of OUD is estimated to be 1% in the commercial insurance population and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14756195">2-4% in the Medicaid population.</a></li>
        <li>Physicians need a special license from the DEA to prescribe methadone and buprenorphine.</li>
        <li>Stark Business Model differences exist between Methadone and Buprenorphine.</li>
        <li>Most drug addiction treatment centers do not accept insurance.</li>
